## After the review

After the findings are reported (and applied, when --fix was passed): if `/${VERIFY_COMMAND_NAME}` has not run this session and the diff has a runtime surface (not test-only or docs-only per the pre-ship exemptions), invoke `/${VERIFY_COMMAND_NAME}` now — this review checks that the diff reads right; `/${VERIFY_COMMAND_NAME}` checks that it runs right.
