  Describes the artifact action preview parameter for locally rendering and
  checking HTML page files before publishing.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
variables:
  - SCREENSHOT_HEIGHT_CAP_PX
-->
 'preview' renders a local page file before you publish it — pass `file_path` (one .html file; files published beside it are not loaded), optionally `widths` (viewport widths in px, default 1280 and 390) and `themes` ('light', 'dark', default both) — and returns a screenshot per width and theme (each shows at most the top ${SCREENSHOT_HEIGHT_CAP_PX} px of the page) plus a checklist of layout and load problems (horizontal overflow, clipped content, theme-only color variables, blocked or local-only loads, diagram and console errors). Nothing is uploaded.
