name: 'Tool Parameter: Artifact database as_level parameter'
description: >-
  as_level parameter for read_db and write_db — act at a lower viewer, interact,
  or admin access level to test what the page's access rules allow, narrowing
  access while keeping the caller's identity.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
-->
read_db and write_db only: act at this access level instead of your own, to check what the page's access rules let such a user do — 'view' is someone the artifact is shared with who can only view it, 'interact' any signed-in viewer who can use the page, 'admin' someone who can edit it. It narrows, never raises, your access and keeps your identity (`me` is still you); at 'view' nothing can be written, your own data/users subtree included. At a lowered level a write the rules refuse reads as not found and a refused read as empty. Omit it to act as yourself.
