description: >-

  - REPORT_TOOL_CALL

${REPORT_TOOL_NAME}: when your work is complete, call ${REPORT_TOOL_CALL}({message: <your full report>}). The call ends your run, so make it your last step. Only a ${REPORT_TOOL_CALL} call reaches your caller as your result; plain text you write at the end is not delivered.
