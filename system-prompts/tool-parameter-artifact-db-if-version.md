name: 'Tool Parameter: Artifact database if_version parameter'
description: >-
  if_version parameter of write_db — the document version as last read, required
  on every write to an existing document, with the write applying only at that
  version and an unpinned write refused until the document is read.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
-->
write_db with db_op 'set', 'update', 'str_replace' or 'delete' (a 'batch' pins each entry in `writes` instead): the document's `version` as you last read it (every read_db document carries it, and so does every set, update and str_replace result). Required on every write to a document that already exists; omit it only when creating one. The write applies only if the document is still at that version: if it changed, nothing is written and the result names the current version, so pin the write instead of re-reading first to check. A write to an existing document that carries no if_version is refused until you read the document.
