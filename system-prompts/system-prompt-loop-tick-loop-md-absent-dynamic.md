# /loop tick — loop.md absent (dynamic pacing)

loop.md is not currently present. Run the autonomous check using the loop instructions established earlier in this conversation.

You scheduled this tick via the ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} tool (not a recurring cron). To keep the loop alive — and to pick up loop.md if it is recreated — call ${SCHEDULE_WAKEUP_TOOL_NAME} again at the end of this turn with `prompt` set to the literal sentinel `${AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_SENTINEL}` and `noop` set to `true` if this tick changed nothing (or `false` if it did) — otherwise the loop ends after this tick.${LOOP_TICK_TAIL}
