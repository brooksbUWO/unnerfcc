A result carrying `next_cursor` has more pages — pass it back as `query.cursor` instead of re-fetching documents one by one.

'write_db' changes the database: `db_op` 'set' (replace) or 'update' (merge) with `collection`, `doc_id`, and either `data` or `file_path` (a local JSON file whose object becomes the document); 'delete' with `collection` + `doc_id`; 'batch' with `writes` (up to
