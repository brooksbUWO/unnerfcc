  Skill description for running Claude Test specs in a fenced headless browser
  against the local dev server, with the guidance on when to run it and when
  only to offer it.

Checks that the web app in this repo still works — plain-language specs in .claude-test/specs/ run in the background in a fenced headless browser against the local dev server, and a PASS / FAIL summary comes back with screenshots. On a first run it proposes a starter set of specs for the person to approve. Use when the user asks ("test my app", "did I break anything?", "run claude test"). When the user asks for it. Unasked, only in a project that already has .claude-test/specs/ and only after a change a person can see in the app — then OFFER to run it in one line; never start it, or begin setup, on your own. Skip for docs-only or test-only changes.
