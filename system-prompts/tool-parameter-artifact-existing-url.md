  url field of the artifact publish tool — pass an existing artifact's claude.ai
  link to update it in place, with the read-before-publish requirement and the
  refusal that hands back the live version.
ccVersion: 2.1.321
-->
An existing artifact's claude.ai link (claude.ai/artifact/{id} or claude.ai/code/artifact/{uuid}; a chat, project or session link is not one) to update in place. Pass whenever the user wants to update an artifact this conversation did not publish — "update my artifact", "keep the same link", a pasted artifact URL — and find the URL with action: "list" or ask the user for the link if you don't have it; without this, the publish creates a separate artifact instead of updating the existing one. Omit for new artifacts and same-conversation redeploys. Must be an artifact the user owns or was given edit access to (a read of it says "writer"). Before publishing to an artifact this conversation has neither read nor published, read it (action: "read") and build on what comes back; a publish sent without that read is refused. A refusal that hands you the live version counts as that read: merge your edits into that version and publish that; never resend the refused content unchanged. For 'read' and the other url-addressed actions: the artifact to act on.
