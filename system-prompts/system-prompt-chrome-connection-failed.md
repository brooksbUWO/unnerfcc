Open Claude in Chrome (browser-occ) is enabled for this session, but the browser connection is not working (it failed or was disabled), so mcp__open-claude-in-chrome__* tools are not available. Do not attempt them. Continue the task without browser tools (WebFetch and WebSearch cover read-only web content), or ask the user to perform browser steps manually. The user can restart the connection with /chrome (Reconnect extension), or turn Open Claude in Chrome (browser-occ) back on in /mcp if it was turned off there.
